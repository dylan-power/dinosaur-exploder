# Contributor Code of Conduct

As community members and contributors of this project, we agree to create a community that is free from harassment.
We promise to interact with each other in a way that fosters a welcoming community where everyone feels comfortable getting involved. 
Our main aim is to connect people from different backgrounds to collaborate, develop skills and have fun while doing so. 
Any behaviour that impedes on this goal is unacceptable. 

## Our Vision

As we aim to create an inclusive community, examples of behaviour we promote are: 

1. Being respectful of differing viewpoints and perspectives
2. Giving criticism that is constructive and beneficial 
3. Exhibiting empathy to other community members
4. Focusing on what is best for our community as a whole

Here are examples of behaviour that will not be tolerated: 

1. Personal attacks on individuals or groups
2. Advances of a sexual nature toward any community member and/or members
3. Spreading of private information such as email addresses without consent
4. Any other behaviour that would be deemed unacceptable in a professional setting

## Applications

Our community code of conduct applies to all spaces within the community. It also applies when representing the community via other channels such as social media
or at events (either in-person or online).

## Enforcement

Any instance of behaviour that is deemed harmful to the community will be dealt with by a community leader. Please contact one of our community leaders in the
event that you or someone you know is facing harassment.

## What Happens When Harassment is Reported?

After intiating contact about harassment through one of the above channels, a community leader will investigate the issue promptly. Depending on the severity
of the harassment, different approaches will be taken. 

If there is a **single instance** of inappropriate behaviour, a warning will be given to the individual by a community leader and an apology will be requested on
behalf of the affected person(s). 

If there happen to be **multiple violations**, a temporary ban will be enacted against the individual responsible. In the unforunate event that an individual continues
harassing behaviour after a temporary ban, this will lead to a **permanent ban** from our community. 

## Attribution

This code of conduct is influenced by the Contributor Covenant, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/.
